# If you are using derby, hsqldb, h2 or mssql with one of the ActiveRecord
# JDBC adapters, configure your database setting as the example below:
#
#development:
#  adapter: mssql
#  username: <username>
#  password: <password>
#  hostname: localhost
#  database: dummy

# If you are using oracle, db2, sybase, informix or prefer to use the plain
# JDBC adapter, configure your database setting as the example below (requires
# you to download and manually install the database vendor's JDBC driver .jar
# file). See your driver documentation for the apropriate driver class and
# connection string:
#
development:
  adapter: jdbc
  username: root
  password: '1234'
  driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
  url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tcc2_development?characterSetResults=UTF-8&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useUnicode=yes

test:
  adapter: jdbc
  username: root
  password: '1234'
  driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
  url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tcc2_test?characterSetResults=UTF-8&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useUnicode=yes

production:
  adapter: jdbc
  username: root
  password: '1234'
  driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
  url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tcc2_production?characterSetResults=UTF-8&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useUnicode=yes
